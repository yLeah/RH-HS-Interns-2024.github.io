                <p>Hey, I'm Sushant and I'm currently a rising junior at Westborough High School in Massachusetts. I participate in my school's Robotics Club, Science Olympiad, and I'm the Co-President of my school's Math Team and Entreprneurship Club. School clubs are fun, but I also really enjoy playing tennis for my school's varsity team.</p>

                <p>I also like to stay busy outside of school with other hobbies. My brother and I have three fish that can glow in the dark and we take care of them every single day. I'm also an avid music listener and off late, my favorite artist has been Travis Scott. I also like to play some video games, whether it's Minecraft, Fortnite, or even Brawl Stars.</p>

                <p>So far, I've really enjoyed the internship experience. I have had the chance to meet some great people and participate in some engaging activities. Even though the internship has been great so far, I can't wait to continue and be a part of the rest of this amazing internship opportunity!</p>
