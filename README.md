# Red Hat High School Internship 2024

This is the homepage for the 2024 Red Hat High School Internship program.

## Developing

Each intern has their own page within the `/intern` directory

To open the page, simply open your `index.html` file. There should be an example header there to start.

The CSS and JS files should already be linked inside of the HTML file. Feel free to add more files and link them correctly.

### Linking new files

If you wanted to add a new CSS file:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="newFile.css"/>`

If you wanted to add a new JS file:

`<script type="text/javascript" src="./newFile.js"></script>`
